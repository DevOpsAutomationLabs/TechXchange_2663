Done. But as the company grew, things changed. </p> <p></p> <p>Internal teams started using the same system. Support places replacement orders for faulty parts, Research &amp; Development requests test components for prototyping. </p> <p>At first glance, these just look like any order. But mixing them together with real customer purchases is causing problems: Finance can\u2019t separate revenue from internal costs, internal orders risk showing up in the customer order history. Clearly, the service needs to evolve. </p> <p>That\u2019s where you come in. Today, you\u2019ll step into the shoes of the developer tasked with making RoboFlow\u2019s ordering system smarter.

You\u2019ll model the change, generate and adjust the code, and deploy a new version of the service. By the end of this lab, RoboFlow will be ready for its next stage of growth.

Since we decided to extend the existing Orders service, the service specification must evolve to reflect the two order types. Updating the specification ensures that the design artifacts (entities, commands, APIs, ...) match the new requirements. From these updated specifications, code is generated, saving development time. </p> <p>In the Workbench, a service specification is divided into namespaces, each covering a different aspect of the service: </p> <p></p> <p>API namespaces define the service\u2019s exposed interfaces. This is where you design the endpoints the clients can call. </p> <p>Domain namespaces capture the service\u2019s bounded context. They contain entities, commands, etc. that represent the core of the service. </p> <p>Integration namespaces manage interactions with other services, acting as a connectivity or anti-corruption layer, while abstracting away technical integration details. </p> <p>With the namespaces in mind, let\u2019s move from theory into practice.

For this, we are starting in the Domain Namespace. </p> <p>What we want to do here is make our Order entity abstract and create two child entities Customer Order and Internal Order. </p> <p></p> <p>We also need a new Factory Command that instantiates either a CustomerOrder or an InternalOrder. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Make Order abstract and create two child entities CustomerOrder and InternalOrder: Learning Center | Design entities </p> </li> <li> <p>Create a factory command that instantiates either a CustomerOrder or an InternalOrder based on an orderType enum and a referenceId: Learning Center | Design Commands (only Step 1-3) </p> </li> </ol> <p>To get the most out of this lab, you will not implement all possible design elements now. Still, we would like to share how the Orders service could be extended. </p> <p>Commands represent actions that can be executed on entities. For the Orders service, you just created a factory command that instantiates either a CustomerOrder or an InternalOrder based on an orderType enum and a referenceId. In addition, you might create an instance command that cancels an existing order. Both of these commands can publish business events so other parts of the system are notified when an order is created or cancelled. </p> <p>Domain Services encapsulate operations that go beyond a single entity. One possible example is a service that cancels all orders belonging to a given customer. This service would take the customerReferenceId as input, look up all related orders, and invoke the cancellation command for each one. If no orders are found, the service would raise a BusinessError. </p> <p>Agents act on events from other services. For example, you might define a CustomerLifecycleEvent that is published by the Customer Management service whenever a customer is deactivated or deleted. An agent within the Orders service could listen for this event and automatically cancel all of that customer\u2019s orders. </p> <p>In this lab, you won\u2019t implement all of these, but you can explore them later in the Learning Center if you want to deepen your understanding. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Designing Instance Commands: Learning Center | Design Instance Command </p> </li> <li> <p>Designing a Domain Service: Learning Center | Design Domain Service </p> </li> <li> <p>Designing Agents: Learning Center | Design Agents</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#api-namespace","title":"API Namespace","text":"<p>The next step to fulfilling the requirement of handling internal orders is to adjust the API the Orders service provides to the outside world. </p> <p>To simplify the creation of REST APIs within a service project, IBM DevOps Solution Workbench offers the API Modelling extension that helps you quickly model REST APIs for various use cases. You can design your API paths, your schemas, parameters, etc., and the Workbench will automatically generate an OpenAPI 3 spec. </p> <p>Since we are changing the existing API, we do not need to model a new path but instead change the API schema. </p> <ol> <li>Adjust the API schema of the existing API namespace to include the orderType enum.

It helps you organize design and implementation artifacts required to connect to external service providers. By encapsulating these integration details, the domain model remains stable even if external APIs evolve \u2013 an approach often referred to as the anti-corruption layer. </p> <p>For the confirmation mail to be sent, we need to create a new API dependency of the Email service, design an Integration Service and map the input parameters. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a new API dependency, create the Integration Service and map the parameters: Learning Center | Design service integration </p> </li> <li> <p>With this, we are done modelling our changes and we can commit everything to the Git repository, just as with any other artifact in the Workbench: Learning Center | Commit and push changes</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"#implement-your-changes","title":"Implement your changes","text":"<p>To continue with the implementation, you can choose any IDE of your choice.
